# Mapping_Earthquakes
## The purpose of this visual display is to capture recent earthquake activity based on USGS Real-Time Data feeds (last 7 days). 
- This data is added to the map as layer that can be toggled on-off by the viewer. 
- The recent earthquakes display as colored circles representing the location and magnitude of the earthquake.
